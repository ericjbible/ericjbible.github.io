# My Awesome Project
This project is a template based frontend project to showcase my resume skills in the context of Web Development. It is meant to be used as a landing page for my Upwork profile.

**Link to project:** https://ericjbible.netlify.app

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project was crafted with an html5up template to establish a design foundation and customized by me. Technologies used were HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## Optimizations

Working on optimizing image sizes for better functionality of the lazy loading feature. Were there less strict ToS for Upwork, I would like to have connected this to a backend for full form functionality. I intend to have functional forms on my main portfolio: https://ericbible.dev

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me practice use of Dev Tools in chrome to troubleshoot CSS and highlighted the importance of optimized image sizes.

## Examples:
Take a look at these other work examples that I have in my own portfolio:
